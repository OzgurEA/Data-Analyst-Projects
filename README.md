# Data-Analyst-Projects
I'm gonna be a data analyst. I'm working on it. And these repositories are where I share my work. 
I am a new data analyst. So my work may seem simple for now. But I'm trying to deepen it more and more every day. 
As my first project, I wanted to start with nba and basketball, which is also my field of interest. 
I have a very large dataset between 96-21. I decided to examine this dataset in detail in line with my projects and studies. 
Instead of doing this examination under a single roof, I developed the idea of doing it piece by piece and presenting it. 
In this way, I can be more up-to-date and my development can be examined more easily. my primary goal is to become a better programmer day by day. 
Thank you for reading my adventure.
